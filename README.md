## Disclaimer
Wildrose is in an early development process. You may experience bugs or unexpected
behaviors, so please, do not hesitate to report any issue to improve user experience.

## Assets
The project is non-commercial, hence, the current assets are not used for any kind
of profit.

## Development
The project is in a development process. Currently, a pygame version is a prototype
that will be rewritten in any alternative production-ready framework. Besides the
codebase, I am designing the assets and will be added as soon as I finish them.
